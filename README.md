# dot
Dot files just the way I like them

## Files
- `.vimrc`: Vim editor settings, save in `$HOME`  
- `.custom-commands.sh`: add `source path/to/dir/.custom-commands.sh` in `~/.bashrc`  
- `.vim-commands.txt`: some commands for Vim editor I'd like to keep note of  

## etc.
To check for your home directory, simply type `echo $HOME` in terminal
